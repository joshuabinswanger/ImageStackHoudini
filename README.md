Convert your Image Stacks to Volume Files for Rendering or Polygon Models

Features (usable with the free apprentice license): 
>Takes in a stack of BW Images and converts it to a volume file in a VDB Container.
>Convert this File to a Polygon Model
>Add a quick Decimation 

>Alternatively you can render the Volume file easily with the Karma renderer native to Houdini (needs a license t get rid of watermark)



This is a Houdini Scene (Indie License). For Rendering without watermark you will need at least a Houdini Indie License.

I am using SideFX Labs nodes in this scene, please install them additionally when installing Houdini. I also use the Fast Polyreduce node. It should be embedded, when error occurs check here: https://www.sidefx.com/forum/topic/84519/?page=1#post-366631
